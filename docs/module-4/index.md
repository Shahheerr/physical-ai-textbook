# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (Placeholder)

## Overview

This module will explore the integration of vision, language, and action systems in humanoid robotics, enabling robots to understand and interact with the world through multiple modalities.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn about vision-language models for robotics
- Understand multimodal perception systems
- Explore action generation from visual and linguistic inputs
- Study embodied language understanding

## Hardware Requirements

This module may include technically demanding topics that require specialized hardware:

- **RTX GPU**: Required for multimodal AI model processing
- **Sufficient RAM**: 16GB+ recommended for complex multimodal computations

## Next Steps

After completing this module, work on the Capstone Project to integrate all your learning.
