# Review Checklist for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Based on PROMPT.md requirements for final polish and review phase.

## I. 📚 Contextual Reference & Technical Standards
- [ ] All styling and configuration follows Docusaurus Documentation standards (https://docusaurus.io/docs)
- [ ] All updates strictly adhere to the project's Embodied Intelligence Constitution

## II. 🛠️ Critical Review & Technical "Stress-Test"
- [ ] Content Re-check: Re-read Modules 1 and 2 to eliminate repetitive language
- [ ] Ensure seamless transition between Physical AI theory (Module 1) and Simulation (Module 2)
- [ ] Code Validation: Verify ROS 2 Python commands (rclpy) syntax is correct
- [ ] Code Validation: Verify URDF snippets syntax is correct
- [ ] Code Validation: Verify all code examples follow industry best practices
- [ ] Fix Broken Links: Use internal link checker to ensure no dead links exist between chapters
- [ ] Fix Broken Links: Ensure no dead links exist in placeholder sections

## III. ✨ Content Refinement & "Value-Add" Polish
- [ ] Rewrite key sections to be more "conversational yet professional"
- [ ] Add "Pro-Tips" boxes for complex topics like Rigid Body Dynamics
- [ ] Add "Expert Warnings" boxes for VSLAM hardware bottlenecks
- [ ] Audit use of Markdown elements for Docusaurus Admonitions (note, tip, danger)
- [ ] Highlight critical information like RTX GPU requirements with admonitions
- [ ] Check image tags and ensure diagrams explaining ROS 2 computational graph are correctly placed
- [ ] Check image tags and ensure diagrams explaining Gazebo world-coordinate system are correctly placed

## IV. 🎨 Frontend & UX Optimization
- [ ] Homepage Final Touch: Ensure main title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence" is high-contrast white text
- [ ] Sidebar Polish: Group weeks into clearly labeled "Quarters" or "Levels" for intuitive navigation
- [ ] Search Optimization: Ensure meta tags enable Docusaurus search to identify core Physical AI keywords

## V. ✅ Final Verification Task
- [ ] Run project locally to ensure no build errors exist
- [ ] Verify branding consistency across browser tab (favicon/title) and main headers
