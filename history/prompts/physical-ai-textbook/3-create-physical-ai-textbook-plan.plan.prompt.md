# Create Physical AI Textbook Plan

## Prompt Text
(sp.plan)

## Response Text
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project, including:

1. Implementation Plan (plan.md): Outlined the technical approach, context, constitution check, and project structure for the Docusaurus-based textbook

2. Research (research.md): Researched Docusaurus setup, GitHub Pages deployment, module structure, content format, and testing strategy

3. Data Model (data-model.md): Defined entities for textbook modules, navigation items, content pages, and learning resources

4. Quickstart Guide (quickstart.md): Created a getting started guide with setup instructions, project structure, and development tips

All artifacts align with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence Constitution principles including Docusaurus-First Documentation, Modular Learning Architecture, and Content-First Development.

## Outcome
Successfully completed Phase 1 of the planning process with all required artifacts created. The project is ready to proceed to task generation and implementation.
