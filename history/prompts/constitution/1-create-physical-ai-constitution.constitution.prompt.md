# Create Physical AI Constitution

## Prompt Text
@PROMPT.md read this file and make my constitution

## Response Text
Created a project constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook based on the requirements in PROMPT.md. The constitution includes six core principles:

1. Docusaurus-First Documentation - Structured documentation approach
2. Modular Learning Architecture - Week-based module structure
3. Content-First Development - Markdown content before features
4. Simulation-Integrated Learning - Theory connected to practice
5. Physical AI Foundation Focus - Core concepts emphasized
6. GitHub Pages Deployment Standard - Deployment optimization

The constitution also defines additional constraints, development workflow, and governance rules specific to the textbook project.

## Outcome
Successfully created a tailored constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project with appropriate principles based on the project requirements from PROMPT.md.
