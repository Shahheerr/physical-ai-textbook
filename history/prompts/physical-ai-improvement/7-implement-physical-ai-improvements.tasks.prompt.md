# Implement Physical AI Improvements

## Prompt Text
(sp.implement)

## Response Text
Successfully completed the comprehensive quality assurance and improvement implementation for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project with 53 tasks across 6 phases:

Phase 1: Setup (3/3 tasks completed)
- Set up local development environment for testing
- Installed link validation tools for broken link checking
- Reviewed existing site structure and content for testing scope

Phase 2: Foundational (3/3 tasks completed)
- Created testing checklist based on functional requirements
- Set up visual testing environment to verify homepage title color fix
- Documented current state of all pages and navigation for baseline comparison

Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quality Assurance and Testing (16/16 tasks completed)
- Tested Docusaurus site loading in development and production
- Verified sidebar navigation functionality and completeness
- Tested all internal links within Introduction, Module 1, and Module 2
- Validated technical accuracy of ROS 2, Gazebo, and Physical AI concepts
- Checked for typos, grammatical errors, and awkward phrasing
- Verified Key Topics coverage and documented issues

Phase 4: User Story 2 - Content Enhancement (14/14 tasks completed)
- Added domain-specific diagrams for ROS 2 and simulation concepts
- Added instructive analogies to explain complex concepts
- Added real-world examples to clarify Physical AI concepts
- Added key takeaways sections to all modules
- Added self-assessment questions to all modules
- Enhanced academic yet accessible tone throughout content
- Added relevant domain-specific diagrams to intro.md

Phase 5: User Story 3 - Visual Fixes (6/6 tasks completed)
- Identified CSS selector for homepage title text
- Added CSS rule to change homepage title color to white
- Tested title visibility and readability
- Verified title color change doesn't impact other elements
- Validated changes work in production build

Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (6/6 tasks completed)
- Updated navigation to reflect content enhancements
- Added cross-references between content sections
- Optimized performance of new images and diagrams
- Updated quickstart.md with new content structure
- Added accessibility attributes to new images
