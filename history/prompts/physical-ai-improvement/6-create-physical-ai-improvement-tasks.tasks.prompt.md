# Create Physical AI Improvement Tasks

## Prompt Text
@PROMPT.md read this file and make the task according to this

## Response Text
Created a comprehensive task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook improvement project with 53 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (3 tasks) - Environment preparation
2. Phase 2: Foundational (6 tasks) - Testing infrastructure setup
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - Quality Assurance and Testing (22 tasks) - Comprehensive site testing
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Content Enhancement (15 tasks) - Content improvements and visual aids
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Visual Fixes (6 tasks) - Homepage title color fix
6. Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (9 tasks) - Final integration and validation

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, and appropriate [P] and [US] labels. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1-P3) to enable independent implementation and testing. The task list addresses all requirements from PROMPT.md including:
- Technical validation and testing of the Docusaurus site
- Content accuracy and quality checks
- Integration of diagrams and visual aids
- Addition of key takeaways and self-assessment questions
- Critical visual fix for homepage title color

## Outcome
Successfully generated a complete, executable task list that maps to the improvement requirements from PROMPT.md, enabling systematic quality assurance, content enhancement, and visual fixes for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.
